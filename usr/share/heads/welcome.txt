Welcome to heads! The version you are using is: 0.2
I hope this finds you well :)

To begin using heads, you can right-click anywhere on the desktop to
open a menu which allows you to easily run applications. If you are
comfortable, in the menu you will also find the AwesomeWM manual and
keybindings.

To connect to the Internet, try using Wicd. You can find the tray icon
on the top-right of the screen, just next to the date and time.

If you want to help with making heads work better on your hardware,
please run 'heads-generate-debug' as root, and email the generated
encrypted tarball to <parazyd@dyne.org>

Thank you, and enjoy!
