Welcome to heads! The version you are using is: 0.3
I hope this finds you well :)

To begin using heads, you can click on the bottom left icon in the
panel to open a menu which allows you to easily run applications.

To connect to the Internet, try using Wicd. You can find the tray icon
on the bottom-right of the screen, just next to the date and time.

If you want to help with making heads work better on your hardware,
please run 'heads-generate-debug' as root, and email the generated
encrypted tarball to <parazyd@dyne.org>

Thank you, and enjoy!
