Welcome to heads! The version you are using is: 0.3
I hope this finds you well :)

To begin using heads, you can right-click anywhere on the desktop to
open a menu which allows you to easily run applications. You can also
run applications using the prompt by pressing MODKEY+r.

To connect to the Internet, try using Wicd. You can find the tray icon
on the upper-left of the screen, just next to the date and time.

If you want to help with making heads work better on your hardware,
please run 'heads-generate-debug' as root, and email the generated
encrypted tarball to <parazyd@dyne.org>

Thank you, and enjoy!
