sup - scale user privileges
===========================
sup is a small and secure tool used for privilege escalation.


Requirements
------------
C99 compiler. sup is statically linked, so there are no runtime
dependencies.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (sup is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install sup
as root:

	make clean install

Further on, edit config.h and fill the correct information that
is related to your needs. When done, just recompile and install
sup again to make the changes effective.


Usage
-----
$ sup [-l] [cmd [arg ...]]

The -l flag will list authorizations that are currently found
in the compiled binary.

Other params will then execute the command if it's allowed and
found in the rules struct found in config.h.
